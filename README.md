#### Tsundoku (積ん読) 
###### *the act of acquiring books and letting them pile up without reading them*
I recently got the entire Harry Potter series and am onto reading it from the very beginning. I'm currently reading **"The Midnight Duel"** from **"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"** <br>
Since, a good friend from ELS suggested this, I started with **Dan Brown's "Angels and Demons"** as well, it's quite engaging. <br>
I left **"Adventures of Sherlock Holmes" Volume 2** midway as I had my midsems back then, will resume shortly. Something similar happened while I was reading **Jane Austen's "Pride and Prejudice"** <br>
However, there are books that I have read over and over again, mostly because they're just too amazing. **"I am Malala"** by **Malala Yousafzai** is simply, extraordinary. She speaks about everything, _her family background, about Pakistani culture, her brothers, her encounters with troubling education norms in Pakistan and the neighbouring countries; she talks about her other identity, **Gul Makai**, the pen name under which she wrote a **BBC diary talking about life under the taliban control.**_ <br>
**Steve Jobs' Biography** was yet another masterpeice in my opinion; the details of which I choose not to mention here (else I might end up taking the whole page)
