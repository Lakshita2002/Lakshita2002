### Hi there 👋
#### Myself [Lakshita Mohanty](github.com/Lakshita2002), an undergraduate student in Mechanical engineering department at IIT Kanpur

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **not going insane during the SPO Intern Season** :relieved:
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with a lot of things in life :neutral_face:
- :cherry_blossom: I once spent 4 hours doing an assignment comprising of 2 questions (ESO203)
- :anger: I spent 4 hours yesterday doing 1 question of ESO209 :notebook_with_decorative_cover:
- :coffee: Coffee, the one thing I love the most and my body decided to react harshly to it; yep, life is good 
- :heart: Tea :tea: and chocos with milk :milk_glass: are my new love; they're basically a rebound :sneezing_face:
- 📫 How to reach me: lakshitamohanty2002@gmail.com :email: lakshita@iitk.ac.in :e-mail:
- ⚡ Fun fact: Online semester sucks if you didn't know already :slightly_smiling_face:
- :bomb: Edit: The new semester sucks real bad, 4 quizzes and 6 assignment submissions in one week is an overkill :skull:
- :slightly_smiling_face: For any sort of RR do not hesitate to contact me (I am not kidding)

#### Tsundoku (積ん読) 
###### *the act of acquiring books and letting them pile up without reading them*
I recently got the entire Harry Potter series and am onto reading it from the very beginning. I'm currently reading **"The Midnight Duel"** from **"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"** <br>
Since, a good friend from ELS suggested this, I started with **Dan Brown's "Angels and Demons"** as well, it's quite engaging. <br>
I left **"Adventures of Sherlock Holmes" Volume 2** midway as I had my midsems back then, will resume shortly. Something similar happened while I was reading **Jane Austen's "Pride and Prejudice"** <br>
However, there are books that I have read over and over again, mostly because they're just too amazing. **"I am Malala"** by **Malala Yousafzai** is simply, extraordinary. She speaks about everything, _her family background, about Pakistani culture, her brothers, her encounters with troubling education norms in Pakistan and the neighbouring countries; she talks about her other identity, **Gul Makai**, the pen name under which she wrote a **BBC diary talking about life under the taliban control.**_ <br>
**Steve Jobs' Biography** was yet another masterpeice in my opinion; the details of which I choose not to mention here (else I might end up taking the whole page)
